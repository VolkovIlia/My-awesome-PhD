	abstract = {High crystalline hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates with high aspect ratio of ∼400 have been synthesized by combustion synthesis method through magnesiothermic reduction reaction between B2O3 and Mg in N2 pressure. The synthesized hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates were about 50 nm in thickness and larger than 20 \ensuremath{\mu}m in lateral size. The six-fold symmetric spots electron diffraction pattern of transmission electron microscopy shows that the nanoplate is well crystallized. Hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates grow via an Oswald ripening process and have larger lateral size when it was prepared with larger magnesium particles. High temperature liquid magnesium provides an important environment for the growth and crystallization of boron nitride. This work provides an effective way to achieve low-cost and large-scale preparation of high-quality boron nitride nanoplates.},

@article{rushton_mesoporous_2007,
	abstract = {We report the synthesis of mesoporous boron nitride materials (boron nitride and a boron-nitride-carbon), via a nitridation/chemical vapour deposition (CVD) route, using mesoporous pure silica SBA-15 or Fe-SBA-15 as hard template, with BH3{\textcdot}NH3, ammonia and acetonitrile as boron, nitrogen and carbon sources respectively. Fe-SBA-15 is obtained by impregnation of Fe(NO3)3{\textcdot}9H2O in SBA-15. The boron precursor, BH3{\textcdot}NH3, is converted into boron nitride within the pores of SBA-15 during nitridation with ammonia at 1150 {\textdegree}C. The boron-nitride-carbon material is obtained by first incorporating carbon (viaCVD at 900 {\textdegree}C using acetonitrile as a carbon source) into the SBA-15/BH3{\textcdot}NH3 composite, followed by nitridation at 1150 {\textdegree}C. The obtained boron nitride materials are porous with relatively high surface areas of 204--380 m2 g--1 and pore volumes in the range 0.46--0.89 cm3 g--1. The boron nitride materials exhibit considerable levels of graphitisation despite the low synthesis temperatures. The use of Fe-SBA-15 as template results in better graphitised boron nitride compared to pure silica SBA-15. The boron-nitride-carbon material exhibits the best graphitisation, and higher surface area and pore volume compared to boron nitride samples. The successful utilization of mesoporous silica, rather than carbon, as a hard template is attractive as it reduces the number of steps in the preparation of the mesoporous boron nitride materials},

The porous precursor B18Ca2(MgO)9 was produced by self-propagation high-temperature synthesis (SHS) method using Mg, B2O3, and CaB6 as the starting materials, which played an important role in synthesis of BN nanotubes in large quantities. Samples were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDX, HRTEM, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The as-synthesized BN nanotubes have an average diameter of about 150\,nm with a wall/diameter ratio of 2/3. Mean length of the BN nanotubes was more than 10\,\ensuremath{\mu}m. The effects of temperature, time, and the possible mechanism of the growth of the BN nanotubes were also discussed.},

	abstract = {Boron nitride nanotubes were synthesized on the iron-deposited alumina substrates by a catalytic reaction of the ball-milled boron and boron nitride powder mixture with ammonia in the temperature range 1000--1200 {\textdegree}C. The diameter of nanotubes is in the range of 40--100 nm. The nanotubes grown below 1100 {\textdegree}C possess exclusively a bamboo-like structure. As the temperature increases to 1200 {\textdegree}C, almost all nanotubes show a cylindrical structure in which the boron nitride sheets are tilted to the tube axis by an angle of about 25{\textdegree}. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy identifies that the ratio of boron and nitrogen is almost one. The Raman scattering peak associated with the E2g mode shifts to the higher frequency and narrows as the growth temperature increases. The results indicate that the growth temperature can be a crucial growth parameter in controlling the structure and crystallinity of boron nitride nanotubes. On the basis of the structural features, we suggest a base-growth mechanism for both bamboo-like and cylindrical boron nitride nanotubes.},

Under the optimized conditions, 3 mol\% of the NiNPs were introduced into a 1.5 M AB solution in TG and held at 80 {\textdegree}C for 6 h under a dynamic vacuum that was maintained at 30 torr. Borazine was isolated through a series of −45 {\textdegree}C, −78 {\textdegree}C, and −196 {\textdegree}C traps to give (−78 {\textdegree}C trap) pure borazine in 53\% yield. The borazine produced was then utilized as a molecular precursor for high quality h-BN (white graphene) and large area h-BN sheets were prepared by applying low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Ultra-thin (single to few layers) h-BN was synthesized on Ni foil at the optimal ratio between borazine and NH3, and the number of layers was tuned by varying the NH3 partial pressure.},

The fibers are polycrystalline consisting of a major phase of turbostratic boron nitride and a three-dimensional ordered phase which is not hexagonal. The density of the fibers is determined by the amount of internal microporosity and crystal interlayer spacing. The existence of internal defects and necking-down defects is described. The resistance of the fibers to refluxing water is shown to be closely related to the interlayer spacing. This effect of the crystal structure on the high thermal stability of the fibers is discussed. The mechanical properties are interpreted in terms of the microcrystalline structure. The electrical resistivity of BN fibers is compared to other insulators and arguments are presented to explain the difference between the conductivity of graphite and boron nitride.},
