	abstract = {High crystalline hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates with high aspect ratio of ∼400 have been synthesized by combustion synthesis method through magnesiothermic reduction reaction between B2O3 and Mg in N2 pressure. The synthesized hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates were about 50 nm in thickness and larger than 20 \ensuremath{\mu}m in lateral size. The six-fold symmetric spots electron diffraction pattern of transmission electron microscopy shows that the nanoplate is well crystallized. Hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates grow via an Oswald ripening process and have larger lateral size when it was prepared with larger magnesium particles. High temperature liquid magnesium provides an important environment for the growth and crystallization of boron nitride. This work provides an effective way to achieve low-cost and large-scale preparation of high-quality boron nitride nanoplates.},

@article{rushton_mesoporous_2007,
	abstract = {We report the synthesis of mesoporous boron nitride materials (boron nitride and a boron-nitride-carbon), via a nitridation/chemical vapour deposition (CVD) route, using mesoporous pure silica SBA-15 or Fe-SBA-15 as hard template, with BH3{\textcdot}NH3, ammonia and acetonitrile as boron, nitrogen and carbon sources respectively. Fe-SBA-15 is obtained by impregnation of Fe(NO3)3{\textcdot}9H2O in SBA-15. The boron precursor, BH3{\textcdot}NH3, is converted into boron nitride within the pores of SBA-15 during nitridation with ammonia at 1150 {\textdegree}C. The boron-nitride-carbon material is obtained by first incorporating carbon (viaCVD at 900 {\textdegree}C using acetonitrile as a carbon source) into the SBA-15/BH3{\textcdot}NH3 composite, followed by nitridation at 1150 {\textdegree}C. The obtained boron nitride materials are porous with relatively high surface areas of 204--380 m2 g--1 and pore volumes in the range 0.46--0.89 cm3 g--1. The boron nitride materials exhibit considerable levels of graphitisation despite the low synthesis temperatures. The use of Fe-SBA-15 as template results in better graphitised boron nitride compared to pure silica SBA-15. The boron-nitride-carbon material exhibits the best graphitisation, and higher surface area and pore volume compared to boron nitride samples. The successful utilization of mesoporous silica, rather than carbon, as a hard template is attractive as it reduces the number of steps in the preparation of the mesoporous boron nitride materials},

	abstract = {Boron nitride nanotubes were synthesized on the iron-deposited alumina substrates by a catalytic reaction of the ball-milled boron and boron nitride powder mixture with ammonia in the temperature range 1000--1200 {\textdegree}C. The diameter of nanotubes is in the range of 40--100 nm. The nanotubes grown below 1100 {\textdegree}C possess exclusively a bamboo-like structure. As the temperature increases to 1200 {\textdegree}C, almost all nanotubes show a cylindrical structure in which the boron nitride sheets are tilted to the tube axis by an angle of about 25{\textdegree}. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy identifies that the ratio of boron and nitrogen is almost one. The Raman scattering peak associated with the E2g mode shifts to the higher frequency and narrows as the growth temperature increases. The results indicate that the growth temperature can be a crucial growth parameter in controlling the structure and crystallinity of boron nitride nanotubes. On the basis of the structural features, we suggest a base-growth mechanism for both bamboo-like and cylindrical boron nitride nanotubes.},

The density of the fibers is determined by the amount of internal microporosity and crystal interlayer spacing. The existence of internal defects and necking-down defects is described. The resistance of the fibers to refluxing water is shown to be closely related to the interlayer spacing. This effect of the crystal structure on the high thermal stability of the fibers is discussed. The mechanical properties are interpreted in terms of the microcrystalline structure. The electrical resistivity of BN fibers is compared to other insulators and arguments are presented to explain the difference between the conductivity of graphite and boron nitride.},

Owing to the unique atomic structure, BNNT has numerous excellent intrinsic properties such as superior mechanical strength , high thermal conductivity, electrically insulating behavior, piezoelectric property, neutron shielding capability, and oxidation resistance. Since BNNT was first synthesized in 1995, developing efficient BNNT production route has been a significant issue due to low yield and poor quality in comparison with CNT, thus limiting its practical uses. However, many great successes in BNNT synthesis have been achieved in recent years, enabling access to this material and paving the way for the development of promising applications. In this article, we discussed current progress in the production of boron nitride nanotube, focusing on the most common and effective methods that have been well established so far. In addition, we presented various applications of BNNT including polymer composite reinforcement, thermal management packages, piezo actuators, and neutron shielding nanomaterial.},

	abstract = {Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) were successfully synthesized by a dc arc discharge using a boron-rich anode as synthesis feedstock in a nitrogen gas environment at near atmospheric pressure. The synthesis was achieved independent of the cathode material suggesting that under such conditions the arc operates in so-called anodic mode with the anode material being consumed by evaporation due to the arc heating. To sustain the arc current by thermionic electron emission, the cathode has to be at sufficiently high temperature, which for a typical arc current density of {\textasciitilde}100\,A/cm2, is above the boron melting point (2350\,K). With both electrodes made from the same boron-rich alloy, we found that the arc operation unstable due to frequent sticking between two molten electrodes and formation of molten droplets. Stable and reliable arc operation and arc synthesis were achieved with the boron-rich anode and the cathode made from a refractory metal which has a melting temperature above the melting point of boron. Ex-situ characterization of synthesized BNNTs with electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that independent of the cathode material, the tubes are primarily single and double walled. The results also show evidence of root-growth of BNNTs produced in the arc discharge.},

Simple and effective control of morphological type of BNNWs by the deposition temperature is demonstrated. Despite the lower synthesis temperature, thermal stability and oxidation resistivity of the maze-like BNNWs are higher than for the wavy nanowalls. The structure and oxidation of the nanowalls was found to be the critical factor for their thermal stability and controlled luminescence properties.

Few-walled, highly crystalline small-diameter BNNTs (?5 nm) are produced exclusively and at an unprecedentedly high rate approaching 20 g/h, without the need for metal catalysts. An exceptionally high cooling rate (?105 K/s) in the induction plasma provides a strong driving force for the abundant nucleation of small-sized B droplets, which are known as effective precursors for small-diameter BNNTs. It is also found that the addition of hydrogen to the reactant gases is crucial for achieving such high-quality, high-yield growth of BNNTs. In the plasma process, hydrogen inhibits the formation of N2 from N radicals and promotes the creation of B--N--H intermediate species, which provide faster chemical pathways to the re-formation of a h-BN-like phase in comparison to nitridation from N2. We also demonstrate the fabrication of macroscopic BNNT assemblies such as yarns, sheets, buckypapers, and transparent thin films at large scales. These findings represent a seminal milestone toward the exploitation of BNNTs in real-world applications.},

	abstract = {A rich variety of hollow and solid (without internal hollow spaces) spherical boron oxynitride nanoparticles (BNO-NPs) with smooth or petalled surfaces were synthesized during a boron oxide-assisted chemical vapour deposition (BOCVD) process. Diverse BNO-NPs were obtained while utilizing different precursors, gas flow rates and synthesis temperatures in the range of 1200--1430 {\textdegree}C. The BNO-NP morphologies, atomic structures and spatially-resolved chemical compositions were studied by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray, Fourier-transform infrared and confocal Raman spectroscopy. Particle size distributions were measured using dynamic light scattering under visual microscopic control. A growth model of different spherical BNO-NP types based on the detailed analysis of physical--chemical processes at different BOCVD stages was proposed. A new type of spherical BNO-NPs of ``hedgehog'' morphologies with BN nanowires on their surfaces was first predicted in accordance with the designed model and then experimentally verified.},

Seventeen years after the initial synthesis of BN nanotubes, research on BN nanomaterials has developed far enough to establish them as one of the most promising inorganic nanosystems. In this regard, it is envisaged that the unique properties of low-dimensional BN systems, such as superb mechanical stiffness, high thermal conductivity, wide optical bandgap, strong ultraviolet emission, thermal stability and chemical inertness will play a key role in prospective developments.},

	abstract = {High global incidence of prostate cancer has led to a focus on prevention and treatment strategies to reduce the impact of this disease in public health. Boron compounds are increasingly recognized as preventative and chemotherapeutic agents. However, systemic administration of soluble boron compounds is hampered by their short half-life and low effectiveness. Here we report on hollow boron nitride (BN) spheres with controlled crystallinity and boron release that decrease cell viability and increase prostate cancer cell apoptosis. In vivo experiments on subcutaneous tumour mouse models treated with BN spheres demonstrated significant suppression of tumour growth. An orthotopic tumour growth model was also utilized and further confirmed the in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of BN spheres. Moreover, the administration of hollow BN spheres with paclitaxel leads to synergetic effects in the suppression of tumour growth. The work demonstrates that hollow BN spheres may function as a new agent for prostate cancer treatment.},
